    <h2>Dates</h2>
    <p>
    It's 10  days since  course started
    & 58  days left until  course ends </Br></br>
    So you can choose if you wanna set in a date like so '01/02/23' in the days function or if you do an variable like so const thisDate = new Date('04/08/2023')
    </br>
    Example 1: <span> days('01/31/2023',currentDate ) </span> 
    </br>
    Example 2: <span> days(endDate, currentDate)</span>
    
    </p>
    <h2>Express server</h2>
    <p>
    To use write
    <span>npm run dev</span>
    Server is hosted on port 5000
    </p>

    <h2>Testing with Chai and Mocha</h2>
    <p>
      This test can be run by writing <span>npm run test</span> in the console, it will test a server that is pulled from the  server file
      on port 6000 and a object result, I did it separetly, because i tried 2 other libraries and decided I go with Mocha and Chai. 
      Will try more testing with React, Testing Library, Jest & Cypress 
      I also read about differences between TDD and BDD.
